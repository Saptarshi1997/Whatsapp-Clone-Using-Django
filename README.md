# Whatsapp-Clone-Using-Django


# Basic Principle/Architechture
This project is basically a real time chat application like whatsapp which supports 
one-one messaging with less latency. In this project Django-channels has been used to 
maintain the connection status stable through the ASGI server and to get real time 
live chat notification we have used Websocket which creates the connection. To get 
less latency we have used redis server.


Tool Used: Python, Django, Django-Channels, Websocket, Redis Server, Rest API, HTML, CSS, Javascript etc.
